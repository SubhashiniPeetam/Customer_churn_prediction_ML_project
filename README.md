# Customer_churn_prediction_ML_project

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or not using machine learning.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained on historical customer data to identify patterns related to customer retention and churn.

The goal is to help businesses:
1. Identify customers at risk of leaving
2. Take preventive actions
3. Improve customer retention strategies

Features:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature encoding and scaling
4. Random Forest model training
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
6. Prediction on new customer data

Technologies Used:
** Python
** Pandas
** NumPy
** Matplotlib / Seaborn
** Scikit-learn
** Pickle (for saving trained model)
** Jupyter Notebook

Model Evaluation:
The model performance is evaluated using:
1. Accuracy score
2. Confusion matrix
3. Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
